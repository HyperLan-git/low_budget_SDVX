# Goal
Finally have a valid reason to use my knowledge of microcontrollers : making a basic DIY Sound Voltex controller.
It's not gonna be particularly good, but it's not gonna cost 200 bucks like the other stuff around the internet.
To cut costs, we can avoid using the same hardware as the arcade cabinets and hack some stuff together.
I am even thinking of not getting buttons at all and using some keyboard switches instead. Yeah.
Things might get dirty.

## Hardware
- 2 encoders
- A microcontroller
//TODO hardware list

## Software
//TODO explain how to compile
